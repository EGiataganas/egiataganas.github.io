            <p>When I was a teenager and the first computer arrived to my home, I became its biggest fan and since then, computers and I are inseparable.</p>
            <p>I have a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Hertfordshire and MSc in Software Engineer from City University London.</p>
            <p>I am a full-stack developer, experienced with the latest technologies Ruby on Rails and JavaScript as well as familiar with the Agile continuous delivery model. I am a knowledge-driven developer with a spherical understanding of
              software engineering, having good knowledge of best practices in designing and building quality products, services and APIs for users. I am passionate about following high coding standards and building well-tested apps following best
              practices.</p>
            <p>Something that sets me apart is that I can see the big picture of an idea, not only from a technical angle but also taking into account user needs and making important decisions beforehand. I am very motivated and I like working in a
              team, as I find it helps me learn not only faster but also be exposed to a variety of technical knowledge.</p>
            <p>I am highly focused on self-development and I love learning new skills in order to help people to modernise and digitalise their workflow. My interests lie in anything related to software development, agile processes and devops.</p>
